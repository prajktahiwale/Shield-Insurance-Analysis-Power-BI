# Shield-Insurance-Analysis-Power-BI
Shield Insurance provides comprehensive insurance plans for individuals and businesses, ensuring protection from unforeseen risks. Known for reliability and customer care, they focus on delivering secure and tailored coverage to keep clients safe and confident.


**Problem Statement**
Shield Insurance aims to improve its data-driven decision-making by implementing a Power BI dashboard for actionable insights into key performance metrics. To evaluate this, they are considering a collaboration with AtliQ Technologies. As a Proof of Concept, Shield Insurance requires a Pilot Project in Power BI to demonstrate AtliQâ€™s capability to meet their specific needs before committing to a full-scale project.


**1.Preliminary Analysis**

1.Show total customers, total revenue, daily revenue growth, daily customer growth as key metrics
2.Month over month change% on key metrics
3.Segment customers based on their age groups: 18-24, 25-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-65, and 65+
4.Total revenue split by age group, city
5.Total customers split by age group, city
6.Customers, daily customer growth trend by month
7.Revenue, daily revenue growth trend by month
8.Create a switch between revenue trend graph and customer trend graph
9.Filters on sale mode, age group, city, month, policy ID
10.Separate page for sales mode analysis
11.Total customers split percentage by sales mode
12.Total revenue split percentage by sales mode
13.Trend of sales mode over month
14.Separate page for age group analysis
15.Age group vs expected settlement
16.Age group vs sales mode
17.Age group vs policy preference

**2. PREPARE**

**Data Storage**:
The dataset is completely available on the Code basis website platform where it stores and consolidates all available datasets for analysis.

**3. PROCESS**

**Tools Used:**
Microsoft Excel
Power BI, DAX Studio, DAX

**Data Used:**

This file contains all the meta information regarding the columns described in the CSV files. we have provided 5 CSV files:
1.dim_customer.csv
2.dim_date.csv
3.dim_policies.csv
4.fact_premiums.csv
5.fact_settlements.csv

**About Data:**

Column Description for dim_customer:
This table contains all the information about the customers
customer_code: Unique code is given to each customer
dob: Customer's date of birth
city:It is the city where the customer is present
Column Description for dim_date:
This table contains the dates at daily, monthly levels and week numbers of the year
date: date at the daily level
mmm_yy:date at the monthly level
day_type:weekday (Sunday, Monday, etc.)
week_no: week number of the year as per the date column
Column Description for dim_policies:
This table contains all policies data

policy_id: unique ID for a particular policy
base_cover: base cover amount for that particular policy
base_premium_amt(INR): The premium amount that the customer has to pay to get the policy
Column Description for fact_premiums:
This table contains all information about policy orders.

date: Date on which the policy is sold
customer_code: Unique code is given to each customer

sales_mode: mode of the sales (Offline-Agent, Offline-Direct, Online-App, Online-Website)
final_premium_amt(INR): The premium amount that is paid for that policy by the customer
Column Description for fact_settlements:
This table contains information about policy settlement

age: Age of the policyholder
settlement% : Percent of policy settlements happend for this age
Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Microsoft Excel, Power Query was used to clean and transform raw data.
From fact_settlement, remove the empty columns
From fact_premiums, split sales_mode columns by delimiter '-' & renamed as Mode: Online/Offline , Mode: Through Medium
Check all the data types & changed into necessary data type. Example: Settlement %

**4. ANALYZE**

**Data Analyzing**
Power BI was used to analyze data.

Key Metrics:
DRG: Daily Revenue Growth (DRG) can be calculated by dividing the total revenue earned in a specific month by the number of unique dates within that month. This calculation gives us a clear picture of how much, on average, the company's revenue is growing each day during that time period.
DCG: Daily Customer Growth (DCR) measures the average daily increase in the customer base during a specific month. It's calculated by dividing the total new customers acquired in a month by the number of unique dates within that month.
DCR provides insights into the daily growth rate of the customer base, helping evaluate the company's ability to attract and retain customers on a day-to-day basis.
